Explanation of the code:

The HTML code defines a single page with a label to display the timer, and three buttons: start, stop, and reset.

The JavaScript code defines four functions to handle the start, stop, and reset functionality. 
The startTimer() function uses the setInterval() function to update the timer every 10 milliseconds, 
and the elapsedTime variable is used to keep track of the current time.

The stopTimer() function uses the clearInterval() function to stop the timer from updating.

The resetTimer() function stops the timer and sets the elapsedTime variable to zero, resetting the timer to its initial state.

The formatTime() function takes a time value in milliseconds and formats it into a string in the format "HH:MM:SS:ms".

The event listeners on the start, stop, and reset buttons call the corresponding functions when clicked.

The async/await keyword is used in the startTimer() function to make the code wait for the interval to start before continuing.

Overall, the code uses a combination of async/await, promises, set interval, and clear interval to create a 
simple stopwatch web application that allows the user to start, stop, and reset the timer, with the timer 
displayed in the format "HH:MM:SS:ms".
